# ML-Playground

A collection of machine learning projects and implementations using Python, aimed at exploring different algorithms and methods. This repository currently includes the following projects:
Implemented Projects
1. Bayesian Tracking

    - **Description**: Implements a Bayesian tracking algorithm using a grid-based approach to estimate the state of a system over time.

2. Gaussian Process Implementation

    - **Description**: Demonstrates Gaussian process (GP) regression for predicting values with associated uncertainties.
    - _To-Do_
        - [ ] Comparison with existing implementation with SciPy GP implementation
        - [ ] Hyperparameter tuning using MLA / MAP / Fully Bayesian.

## To-Do: Potential Future Projects
   - [ ] Kalman Filter: Implement a Kalman filter for linear state estimation and compare its performance with Bayesian tracking.
   - [ ] Particle Filter: Introduce a particle filter for non-linear, non-Gaussian tracking scenarios
   - [ ] Reinforcement Learning: Create a basic reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning or policy gradients.
   - [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM): Implement SVM from scratch and apply it to a classification problem
   - [ ] Time Series Analysis: Apply Gaussian processes or ARIMA models to a real-world time series dataset.
   - [ ] Dimensionality Reduction: Explore PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for visualizing high-dimensional data.
   - [ ] Kalman Filter for 3D Pose Estimation: Using Handy IMU to estimate its 3d pose
